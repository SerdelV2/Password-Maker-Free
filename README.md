# Password-Maker-Free
It is very simple program to generating passwords and saving them into .txt file in specified directory. 

This repository contains .py file of the program with config file so you can change the place where to save passwords and also the lenght of genereted ones and then compile it to executable if you want.
But it contains also already compiled .exe file. Now it runs in CMD but maybe in the future when I'll improve my poor programming skills I will create GUI for this program.
